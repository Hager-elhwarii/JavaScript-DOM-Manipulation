## ðŸŒ¸ About this Repo
I created this repo as a resource to help you better understand and learn the `Dom`, and was organized in a way I thought made the most sense when I was learning it.
- With HTML and CSS, you can build visually appealing static web pages. With a bit of `JavaScript`, you can add dynamic behavior to these static websites.
- In this `Dom Manipulation` repo, I Learned the basics of JavaScript DOM Manipulation by doing **5 Simple Projects.**
